# Quantitative Methods I Group Project
## This was a project by Frederic Denker & Nicolas Göller

The result of the project can be seen in this [html file preview](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/NicolasGoeller/QM_DowJones_GoogleSearches/blob/master/QM_Group_3.html). This time frame of this presentation was very short (about 24h), which means that the scope was limited. 

If you are familiar with multivariate Time Series Analysis you will see that the logic has its flaw in the sense that both could be random walks while at the same time being dependent on another. We did not know that at the time as we had only looked at univariate Time Series Analysis.

The Google Trend analysis was done by Nicolas Göller, while the Dow Jones Analysis was Frederic's part. All the code for the html document is fully reproducable by using the rmd file. 

If you are not happy with the html file preview, we can recommend downloading the whole repo as a .zip file and then view the html document directly.
